# Color Changing Clock
A simple color-changing clock app built using Python and Tkinter for practice. The clock displays the current time in pink and changes its color to red every 5 seconds.

## Usage
- Run the script `main.py` to start the clock.
- The clock will display the current time and change color to red every 5 seconds.

### Main Components
- **Imports**: Imports necessary modules from Tkinter and `strftime` from the `time` module.
- **Main Window**: Creates the main application window and sets the title.
- **Time Function**: Updates the time and changes the color based calculation.
- **Label**: A Tkinter `Label` widget to display the time.
- **Main Loop**: Starts the Tkinter event loop.

## Future Improvements
- Add user-selectable color options.
- Display additional information such as date, day of the week, etc.
- Integrate with other libraries or APIs for more functionality.
